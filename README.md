## Vibecoding Note

This project was built with the assistance of Gemini, an AI developed by Google. As an independent security researcher, I used AI to accelerate development and learn best practices, but I have reviewed and understood the code to ensure it aligns with my skills and goals. This demonstrates my ability to leverage modern tools while building practical cybersecurity solutions.
